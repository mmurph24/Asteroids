This is the V1 of a crappy little  game I made in a weekend while attempting to learn JQuery. There are a bunch of areas where things can be improved that I'll be working on:

* Using loops to generate asteroids without duplicative if statements
* Using loops to identify fireball/asteroid collisions without duplicative if statements
* A better way to handle levels and scoring
