This is the V1 of a crappy little  game I made in a weekend while attempting to learn JQuery.

There are a bunch of areas where things can be improved:

> Smarter logic in generating asteroids without duplicative if statements
> Real collision detection between the fireball and asteroids instead of relying on .offset() (which breaks if you zoom in)
> Less randomness in how asteroids are added
